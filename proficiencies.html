            Resilience is a value that I hold very dear to myself. While some might wallow in self-pity when
            encountering failure, I see self-pity as an extremely self-limiting act that does not help in
            moving towards my end goals. What I do instead, in the face of rejection/failure, is that I research on
            alternate solutions and actively take steps towards them. I firmly believe that making progress and
            bettering myself is the best way to move on from a setback.

        <p class="info_text">
            As a commander for more than 1 year in the army, I've undertaken many responsibilities - all of which I take
            very seriously. I've never missed out on details or forgotten a set of instructions and I ensure that all
            operational demands are met in a timely fashion with no details skimmed over.
            My efforts were recognised and I have since received a few rewards, and even a coveted nomination for a rank
            promotion. In
            addition, thanks to my strict but fair leadership style, my superior officers, colleagues and subordinates
            have all expressed regret with regards to me leaving when my Operationally Ready for Deployment(ORD)
            date drew close.

        <h2>Enthusiastic and eager to learn</h2>
        <p><img src="https://www.clearlypayments.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lean.jpg" alt="Learning"
                class="interest_pic"></p>
        <p class="info_text">
            Since young, I've always been absolutely fascinated at how different items work and what makes them tick. As
            a kid, I would often spend time taking apart toys such as spring-loaded guns or remote-controlled cars
            trying to
            understand how they work and how I could combine them to create the ultimate machine.
            I'm no different now, always curious and wanting to find out more about basically everything under the sun.
            This has crafted me to become an individual who is forever knowledge hungry especially when it comes to
            something of interest. This is one of the reasons why I picked up computer programming actually and
            honestly, my only regret was not starting earlier. The only limit to the possibilities a computer can do is
            the developer's
            own creativity. On my journey of learning to write programs, I realised that many people only talk about
            what they will do or learn but end up putting it off for an unforeseeable long amount of time due to
            laziness. Fortunately, I do not adopt the same mindset. My enthusiasm coupled with my eager to learn nature
            means that I do not put off new topics - instead, I dive head first into them.
            <br><br>
            Sometimes, I do not even bother finishing the educational course before embarking on my own projects just so
            I can learn
            by doing. I find that I understand and retain information best when I'm actively applying what I've learnt.

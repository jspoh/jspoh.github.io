                    <strong>Sanda kickboxing</strong><br><br>
                    I started this hobby in May 2017, when I joined
                    Nanyang Polytechnic's Kickboxing
                    CCA. Knowing I could excel in anything I put my heart to, I invested loads of time and
                    effort into this activity which landed me in Nanyang Polytechnic's fight team. I went
                    on to represent the school in a competition in January 2018 where I was drafted for
                    the national team. I was then offered an opportunity to represent Singapore in the under 18s
                    division
                    but
                    did not
                    participate due to flak from my parents and the fact that I was going on a semester long overseas
                    exchange
                    program
                    soon.
                    Nevertheless, I
                    truly treasured my time in the national team and it imparted a few significant values that I
                    still follow to this day.

                    <strong>Playing the piano</strong><br><br>
                    I started learning how to play the piano in
                    2007,
                    after my first
                    music class in primary school. Since then, my love for music grew and I started seeing this as a
                    channel
                    to
                    unleash my creativity. Growing up, all of my schools have free access to musical instruments for
                    students
                    and
                    having a family
                    that is supportive both emotionally and financially was a huge bonus.
                    Being a part of Piano Ensemble(club) in polytechnic has also allowed me to participate in various
                    events,
                    concerts and
                    musical productions.<br><br>
                    As an "ear-player", I can play almost any song just by listening to it once
                    or
                    twice.
                    Do let me know if you have any song requests!

                <p class="info_text"><strong>How it started</strong><br><br>My entry point into coding
                    was through the Grand-Theft-Auto(GTA) modding community where my gameplay experience can be enhanced
                    via my own scripts. However, I realised this required knowledge in C. This inspired me to start
                    learning python in order to build up my foundation and I have since moved on to other languages such
                    as C for a deeper understanding of how a computer works, and HTML CSS JS in order to easily build
                    programs/websites with nice GUIs. Sticking wit more languages and their purposes.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm actually planning to pick up C# next to make use of the unity game engine and after I'm more or
                    less familiar in it, I would like to transition to using unreal engine with C++.

                <p class="info_text"><strong>How has programming improved your life?</strong><br><br>I've actually
                    started using programs for automation since I was in secondary school. Being one that would rather
                    "work smart" instead of "work hard", I was always one to look for better, more efficient ways to do
                    things. This led to me experimenting with simple programs built for automation - mainly to use in
                    games. I actually benefitted significantly because it saved me a lot of time from "grinding" these
                    games - which meant I could spend more time resting or on schoolwork.
                    <br><br>As someone that loves understanding how things work, I actually spent a lot of time looking
                    through the source codes and trying my best to figure out what everything meant and how words can
                    make a computer do stuff. Unfortunately, it was to no avail as I basically had zero
                    programming knowledge at that point. It was only till I got a little older and started playing GTA
                    before I really went and put in the effort to start learning. I really wished I started earlier
                    though, but as a kid, my attention span was pretty short but hey, better late than never right?
                    <br><br>
                    In addition, I seem to have taken a great interest in writing algorithms to solve mathematical
                    problems on websites such as leetcode, hackerrank and w3schools. This feels particularly refreshing
                    for me, someone who has spent more than 2 years in the army, as it feels as though I'm getting' to
                    sharpen my brain mentally again after a long break.

                <p class="info_text"><strong>Business > Technology?</strong><br><br>I understand that some may be
                    wondering
                    why
                    I decided to pursue a career in Technology instead of Business, considering that my Diploma was in
                    business
                    management. Here's why.
                    <br><br>
                    When I graduated from secondary school, I have already set my sights
                    on
                    "doing business"
                    in the future. I knew that I did not want to conform to the dress codes and 8-5 school schedule that
                    junior
                    colleges had
                    hence chose to enter a polytechnic. In hindsight, 16 year old me actually had no idea what "doing
                    business"
                    actually meant and
                    chose the course just because it sounded cool. Although I did have a lot of fun and did get to
                    interact
                    with
                    many people
                    with different views on different subjects, I only realised during my internship as a human
                    resources
                    assistant that I did not feel
                    mentally stimulated and that I could not handle doing simple repetitve tasks for the rest of my
                    career.
                    This
                    led
                    to a lot of self-reflection and through discussion with my friends, it finally dawned on me that I
                    have
                    been
                    fiddling with
                    software not because of homework or anything, but out of pure interest. I realised that I was
                    happiest
                    when
                    making games or automation software that can improve people's way of life and efficiency. On top of
                    that,
                    having new challenges to solve frequently and doing meaningful work that can directly impact others
                    positively on a daily basis sounds like the perfect job for me.

                Goal setting is important. Having goals drives one to
                put in the required effort to work towards it. Those who don't realise the value of goal setting will
                stagnate and then
                wonder why everyone around them is advancing while they are stagnant. <br><br>
                Throughout my programming journey so far, I've experimented with different areas of programming and I've
                found that I enjoy making games the most. Apart from the ability to make ideas come to life, I've seen
                snippets of warzone's RICHOCHET anti-cheat system trolling
                game hackers through applying damage shields and I find them really entertaining. It would be a pleasure
                if
                I am able to be part of a team
                that writes software like this. Being part of a team developing and maintaining a game also feels like
                it
                would
                be a lot of fun - especially when you're trying to find loopholes to exploit and then patching it
                yourself.
                <br><br>
                My short-term goals would be to learn the knowledge and skills required during my studies while securing
                internships in the gaming industry to gain experience. My long term goal would be to one day lead a team
                of
                competent software engineers in developing games or anti-cheat software.
                <br><br>
                If not, I would love to lead a competent team towards building, designing and maintaining software that
                adds values to people's lives. Reading about how software advances such as apple watch's fall detection
                system helping save the life of a motorcyclist back in September 2021 after a hit and run really warms
                my heart. If I am unable to work with games as a career, I would love to at least be developing software
                that can better others' lives.

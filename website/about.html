            Nanyang
            Polytechnic
            with
            a Diploma in Business Management specialising in Human Resources and International Business in April 2020. I
            will be entering Singapore University of Social Sciences in Oct to pursue my bachelors in Information and
            Communications Technology! My interests include kickboxing, playing the piano, and also writing programs
            designed to automate tedious
            processes and also creating visually pleasing games. My MBTI is ESTJ-A for those who are interested!</p>

                <strong>Sanda kickboxing</strong><br><br>
                I started this hobby in May 2017, when I joined
                Nanyang Polytechnic's Kickboxing
                CCA. Knowing I could excel in anything I put my heart to, I invested loads of time and
                effort into this activity which landed me in Nanyang Polytechnic's fight team. I went
                on to represent the school in a competition in January 2018 where I was drafted for
                the national team. I was then offered an opportunity to represent Singapore in the under 18s division
                but
                did not
                participate due to flak from my parents and the fact that I was going on a semester long overseas
                exchange
                program
                soon.
                Nevertheless, I
                truly treasured my time in the national team and it imparted a few significant values that I
                still follow to this day.

                <strong>Playing the piano</strong><br><br>
                I started learning how to play the piano in
                2007,
                after my first
                music class in primary school. Since then, my love for music grew and I started seeing this as a channel
                to
                unleash my creativity. Growing up, all of my schools have free access to musical instruments for
                students
                and
                having a family
                that is supportive both emotionally and financially was a huge bonus.
                Being a part of Piano Ensemble(club) in polytechnic has also allowed me to participate in various
                events,
                concerts and
                musical productions.<br><br>
                As an "ear-player", I can play almost any song just by listening to it once
                or
                twice.
                Do let me know if you have any song requests!

            <p class="info_text"><strong>How it started</strong><br><br>My entry point into coding
                was through the
                Grand-Theft-Auto(GTA) modding community where my gameplay experience can be enhanced via my own scripts.
                However, I realised this required knowledge in C. This inspired me to start learning python in order to
                build up my foundation and I have since moved on to other languages such as C for a deeper understanding
                of
                how a computer works, and HTML CSS JS in order to easily build programs/websites with nice GUIs.
                Sticking
                with python was nice, but in order to make the most out of my potential, I had to move on and learn more
                languages and their purposes.</p>

            <p class="info_text"><strong>How has programming improved your life?</strong><br><br>I've actually started
                using
                programs for
                automation since I was in secondary school. Being one that would rather "work smart" instead of "work
                hard",
                I was always one to look for better, more efficient ways to do things. This led to me experimenting with
                simple programs built
                for automation - mainly to use in games. I actually benefitted significantly because it saved me a lot
                of
                time from "grinding" these games - which meant I could spend more time resting or on schoolwork.
                <br><br>As
                someone that
                loves understanding
                how things work, I actually spent a lot of time looking through the source codes and trying my best to
                figure out what everything meant and
                how words can make a computer do stuff. Unfortunately, it was to no avail as I basically had zero
                programming knowledge at that point. It was only till I got a little older and started playing GTA
                before I
                really went and put in the effort to start learning. I really wished I started earlier though, but as a
                kid,
                my attention span was pretty short but hey, better late than never right?

            <p class="info_text"><strong>Business > Technology?</strong><br><br>I understand that some may be wondering
                why
                I decided to pursue a career in Technology instead of Business, considering that my Diploma was in
                business
                management. Here's why. <br><br>When I graduated from secondary school, I have already set my sights on
                "doing business"
                in the future. I knew that I did not want to conform to the dress codes and 8-5 school schedule that
                junior
                colleges had
                hence chose to enter a polytechnic. In hindsight, 16 year old me actually had no idea what "doing
                business"
                actually meant and
                chose the course just because it sounded cool. Although I did have a lot of fun and did get to interact
                with
                many people
                with different views on different subjects, I only realised during my internship as a human resources
                assistant that I did not feel
                mentally stimulated and that I could not handle doing simple repetitve tasks for the rest of my career.
                This
                led
                to a lot of self-reflection and through discussion with my friends, it finally dawned on me that I have
                been
                fiddling with
                software not because of homework or anything, but out of pure interest. I realised that I was happiest
                when
                making games or automation software that can improve people's way of life and efficiency. On top of
                that,
                having new challenges to solve frequently and doing meaningful work that can directly impact others
                positively on a daily basis sounds like the perfect job for me.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="info_text animated revealU"><strong>My career goals</strong> <br><br>
            Goal setting is important. Having goals drives one to
            put in the required effort to work towards it. Those who don't realise the value of goal setting will
            stagnate and then
            wonder why everyone around them is advancing while they are stagnant. <br><br>
            Throughout my programming journey so far, I've experimented with different areas of programming and I've
            found that I enjoy making games the most. Apart from the ability to make ideas come to life, I've seen
            snippets of warzone's RICHOCHET anti-cheat system trolling
            game hackers through applying damage shields and I find them really entertaining. It would be a pleasure if
            I am able to be part of a team
            that writes software like this. Being part of a team developing and maintaining a game also feels like it
            would
            be a lot of fun - especially when you're trying to find loopholes to exploit and then patching it yourself.
            <br><br>
            My short-term goals would be to learn the knowledge and skills required during my studies while securing
            internships in the gaming industry to gain experience. My long term goal would be to one day lead a team of
            competent software engineers in developing games or anti-cheat software.

                        Resilience is a value that I hold very dear to myself. While some might wallow in self-pity when
                        encountering failure, I see self-pity as an extremely self-limiting act that does not help in
                        moving towards my end goals. What I do instead, in the face of rejection/failure, is that I
                        research
                        on
                        alternate solutions and actively take steps towards them. I firmly believe that making progress
                        and
                        bettering myself is the best way to move on from a setback.

                        which I take
                        very seriously. I've never missed out on details or forgotten a set of instructions and I ensure

                        Since young, I've always been absolutely fascinated at how different items work and what makes
                        them
                        tick. As
                        a kid, I would often spend time taking apart toys such as spring-loaded guns or
                        remote-controlled
                        cars
                        trying to
                        understand how they work and how I could combine them to create the ultimate machine.
                        I'm no different now, always curious and wanting to find out more about basically everything
                        under
                        the sun.
                        This has crafted me to become an individual who is forever knowledge hungry especially when it
                        comes
                        to
                        something of interest. This is one of the reasons why I picked up computer programming actually
                        and
                        honestly, my only regret was not starting earlier. The only limit to the possibilities a
                        computer
                        can do is
                        the developer's
                        own creativity. On my journey of learning to write programs, I realised that many people only
                        talk
                        about
                        what they will do or learn but end up putting it off for an unforeseeable long amount of time
                        due to
                        laziness. Fortunately, I do not adopt the same mindset. My enthusiasm coupled with my eager to
                        learn
                        nature
                        means that I do not put off new topics - instead, I dive head first into them.

                        Sometimes, I do not even bother finishing the educational course before embarking on my own
                        projects
                        just so
                        I can learn
                        by doing. I find that I understand and retain information best when I'm actively applying what
                        I've
                        learnt.

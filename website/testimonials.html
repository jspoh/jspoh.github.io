                    well liked and respected by troopers in his platoon as he puts in the effort to understand and
                    connect with his troopers on a personal level. With this, he has not only earned the troopers' trust
                    but this has also enabled him to understand troopers on a personal a deeper level hence helps the
                    platoon commander make better decisions for the platoon. There were many a time where he has helped
                    troopers who were unwell or feeling distressed by being there for them in their time of need. This
                    has made him an extremely valuable team member in the command team.

                    without panic. This is shown when he can calmly handle operations in the Chong Pang guardroom during
                    adverse times where others would just submit to the stress, 3SG Poh Jing Seng holds his ground
                    calmly and with utmost professionalism.

                    His friendly and approachable personality has allowed for more open communication and mutual
                    agreements between the troopers and the command team. He leads his troopers confidently with respect
                    and compassion much alike a servant leader rather than leadership through fear and rank superiority.
                    This allows him to work with his troopers without trouble as trust that he has their best in mind.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="smaller">

                    as their detailing carefully and meticulously keeping in mind to evenly distribute the manpower and
                    workload. While not on duty, he often offers himself to the task when help is needed. For example to
                    fill in for troopers when they are not feeling well or if the operation requires more people on the
                    ground to assist.

                    can. Having him as a commander in the squadron has been invaluable. Inconclusion, 3SG Poh Jing Seng
                    is a versatile and all-rounded commander who was a vital team player in his platoon during his

                <p>Relationship to me: Former colleague / Friend / Mentor</p>
                <br>
                <p class="smaller">
                    I have known Jing Seng for a year as a colleague, mentee, and a friend. As his senior in the
                    Singapore Armed Forces as a Military Police Specialist as well as his mentor in programming, I have
                    seen the vast progress that he has made over the past year and I believe that his grit and
                    determination for self-improvement is commendable.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="smaller">
                    As a Military Police Specialist, Jing Seng had demonstrated much leadership when it came to managing
                    the troopers under his charge. His passion in service has motivated his troopers to look up to him
                    as a role model with great respect and admiration. His confidence in making decisions was impeccable
                    - he had never hesitated in deciding to do what was morally right, and had never once doubted his
                    own decisions. Jing Seng was always thorough in his work, and this is evident in his vigilance in
                    his security checks, which earned him the “Best Airman of the Month” award in his first month of
                    service.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="smaller">
                    No matter the time of day, be it in the afternoon, or the middle of the night, when activated for
                    operations, Jing Seng would always be the first to have his equipment and gear ready, and be
                    prepared for the operations. He has great management of manpower resources to ensure that his team
                    would be ready to be activated at any time of day, allowing his superiors to place trust in him and
                    his team.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="smaller">
                    Despite increasing workload, Jing Seng was always very hardworking and diligent in his work, and
                    even reassured the people around him that he would not falter in the face of pressure. This is
                    testament of his stress-management as well as time-management abilities, and I believe that his
                    resilience is a quality that would help to propel him through rigorous academic programmes.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="smaller">
                    His trustworthiness stems from his honesty and integrity, which makes him stand out from the rest of
                    his peers. Jing Seng’s goals have always been in line with the organisation’s missions, and he
                    ensures that his decisions were to always lead to the betterment of the organisation.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="smaller">
                    After having completed my service in the Singapore Armed Forces, Jing Seng reached out to me to seek
                    mentorship for Programming and Computer Science-related topics. Having seen his professional work
                    ethics, as well as passion for the things that he does, I believe that him taking the initiative in
                    looking for a mentor truly showed his burning passion for the topic matter, and has much interest in
                    the field.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="smaller">
                    Throughout the course of the mentorship thus far, I have found Jing Seng to be a very eager and
                    earnest learner who always sought to learn more. He always goes beyond what is expected of him and
                    never fails to have his preparation done before seeking help. His inquisitive mind greatly aids his
                    self-learning, and coupled with his self-motivation, he would always surprise me with how quickly he
                    is able to pick up new concepts. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="smaller">
                    Jing Seng is a natural problem-solver and constantly looks for ways to improve processes. His
                    open-mindedness to learning new skills has helped him gain much experience and exposure to analysing
                    and problem solving. Even when I tried to tempt him with shortcuts, he would always try his best
                    before seeking help. He is hardworking and patient, and would never succumb to failure. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="smaller">
                    Besides the observations made from being his senior, as well as his mentor, I have also learnt about
                    his past accomplishments, which I feel would have provided him with the values and qualities in
                    performing well in the Computer Sciences.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="smaller">
                    He had shared with me about his Sanda (Chinese kickboxing) journey that started in 2017. Having only
                    practised Sanda for about a year, he had gone for a Sanda friendly match in 2018, and had attracted
                    the attention of the National Sanda Team. Shortly after the match, he was invited to join the
                    National Sanda Centralised Training Squad, in which he had gone for more advanced training. I
                    believe that this achievement of his really demonstrates his ability to pick up skills quickly,
                    which is essential in the world of ever-changing technology.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="smaller">
                    Aside from his interest in Sanda, he also takes great interest in music, with the piano being his
                    most-preferred instrument. With his experience in his school’s Piano Ensemble, he now has the
                    ability to play any song that he has heard before on the piano easily, which is another distinct
                    example of his ability to pick up skills quickly. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="smaller">
                    Jing Seng takes much pride in his work and believes in his own abilities. For someone with such
                    great potential for growth and development, I believe that he will be able to outperform his peers
                    and be an indispensable asset of any organisation.

                <p class="smaller">
                    It is my pleasure to recommend Jing Seng for entry into your organisation. As his colleague and
                    friend in the Singapore Armed Forces, Military Police Specialist, I have witnessed Jing Seng growing
                    into an exceptional individual who excels in his personal goals. Not only is he an excellent and
                    hardworking specialist, but he has also dedicated himself to care for both his troopers and fellow
                    specialists. Jing Seng is truly a key figure in our platoon who motivates others.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="smaller">
                    Jing Seng has displayed both leadership and confidence in his work as a Military Police Specialist.
                    His knowledge and professionalism in the operations that we conduct on a daily basis has helped the
                    people around him make it a smooth sailing one. Because of his vast knowledge in our operations, his
                    troopers look up to him as a leader who always has their backs whenever they need help. Throughout
                    the duration of our operations, Jing Seng is always very detailed and precise in his area of work.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="smaller">
                    Our operations are round the clock on a daily basis and Jing Seng will often be on duty for long
                    hours. Despite that, the quality in his work which he produces are always of high standards. Jing
                    Seng’s management in his troopers' manpower and of his troopers' duty hours with frequent last
                    minute fluctuations to ops requirements and manning are also examples of his strong ability to work
                    under pressure. Jing Seng is always ready to lend a helping hand to whomever that is in need or
                    whenever help is required. Because of his quality work and care for his fellow soldiers, he was
                    awarded “Best Airman of The Month” back in June 2021.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="smaller">
                    During Jing Seng’s free time, he would study and research about Computer Science topics and also
                    practice on his coding skills. He has progressed to a great extent in his knowledge and skills in
                    programming. As a diploma holder in cybersecurity and forensics, he often looks to me for my past
                    experiences with Information Technology and programming modules. On his off days, he would often
                    message me about a new programming language that he has learnt or he would show me what he has coded
                    and built. With Jing Seng’s constant curiosity and eagerness to learn more, he would research and
                    seek for help whenever he is facing problems with his codes. Through his admirable determination and
                    self-motivation, Jing Seng has rapidly increased his knowledge and skills in programming.

                    Through Jing Seng’s determination and enthusiasm in self-learning programming languages, his
                    motivation to pursue Information Technology as a career in the future is evident. Although he does
                    encounter hardships and failure when it comes to programming, he does not see failure as a negative
                    impact of his skills, but an opportunity to learn and grow from his mistakes. This shows the level
                    of perseverance Jing Seng possesses. Learning programming has also granted Jing Seng the ability to
                    think analytically.

                    Aside from the qualities and skills of a programmer, Jing Seng has also demonstrated a strong sense
                    of leadership and determination in his CCA in Nanyang Polytechnic. In 2017, Jing Seng joined the
                    Sanda (Chinese Kick Boxing) CCA despite not having any past experiences with Martial Arts. After
                    practicing Sanda for about a year, he was recognised by his seniors and coaches and went for a
                    friendly match in 2018. He was then drafted by the National Sanda Team through his exemplary
                    performance and that is where Jing Seng was able to further train and improve his skills.
                </p>

                <p class="smaller">
                    Jing Seng is also interested in music. In secondary school, he joined his school’s Piano Ensemble
                    CCA and performed in various events in school. With his skills to play such a difficult and complex
                    instrument, this shows me that Jing Seng is very talented and is able to learn and handle complex
                    situation or tasks. This proves the ability that he has to learn something complex and new.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="smaller">
                    Jing Seng has my enthusiastic recommendation. He is an intelligent, self-motivated, and caring
                    person who has a clear sense of purpose and direction. While Information Technology can be a
                    competitive field, through demonstration of his work ethics, I believe Jing Seng to possess the
                    capability and capacity to succeed in this field. I know that he will continually impress the
                    organisation with his skills and talents. I am excited to see how far his educational and
                    professional journey will take him in the future.

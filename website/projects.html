                This program will play the classic tictactoe game with you. It will try its best to win you or at least
                prevent you from winning. The player may use their mouse to click on the box they'd like to select. <br>
                It is still possible to win against the AI as it will not always choose the center positioning even if
                the player did not select it.

                <hr>
                <br><br>
                I made this javascript version mainly to learn and practice writing and implementing the minimax
                algorithm.
                <br> <br>
                Although it was super tedious and frustrating trying to write my own code initially, I'm glad I went
                through it as I feel as though I've learnt quite a bit more about recursive functions and AI development
                for games.
                <br><br>
                This tictactoe version features: <br>
                - 3 game modes to choose from<br>
                - Unbeatable AI.<br>
                <br>
                Players may choose to go first, allow the AI to go first, or a PvP gamemode with friends. <br>
                If the player chooses to go first, the game will always result in a loss/draw but if the AI goes first
                and the player does not select the center box in his/her first turn, the AI will always win.
